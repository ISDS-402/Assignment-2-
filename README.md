# Assignment-2- Due Sunday
Here is where you'll find the SQL text files for creating tables and Inserting dummy data. 
I've also attached the SQL code examples that Dr. Gonzalez provided us. 

If you have management stuido, I recommend that you run all the SQL code in both files to make sure it works. The code for creating tables works just fine. But, Kelvin ran into some errors when inserting data. We can try to fix the errors today, but if necessary one of us will have to go to office hours. 

Let us know if you have any questions.
