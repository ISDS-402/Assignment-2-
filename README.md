# Assignment-2- Due Sunday - 2/23
Here is where you'll find the SQL text files for creating tables and Inserting dummy data. 
I've also attached the SQL code examples that Dr. Gonzalez provided us. 

If you have management studio, I recommend that you run all the SQL code from both files to make sure it works. Initially, Kelvin ran into some errors when inserting data, but I think I fixed them. Don't take my word for it though. 

Let the group know if you have any questions
