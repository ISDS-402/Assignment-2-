# Assignment-2- Due Sunday - 2/23
Here is where you'll find the SQL text files for creating tables, Inserting dummy data, and assignment instructions 
I've also attached the SQL code examples that Dr. Gonzalez provided us. 

If you have management studio, I recommend that you run all the SQL code from both files to make sure it works. Initially, Kelvin ran into some errors when inserting data, but I think I fixed them. Moreover, we ran all of the code from both text files in management studio and had no issues. Don't take my word for it though. 

Just need to enter data in a couple more tables 

Let the group know if you have any questions

P.S. I consulted with Dr. Gonzalez to make sure the table relationships diagram in lucid charts is correct.
