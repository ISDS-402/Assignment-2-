It will often be the case that all the group cannot get together to finish an assignment. But that doesn't mean that you are excluded. 
If you were unable to contribute to the coding part of the assignment, you can still practice it by double-checking the code and asking questions. 


We'll work around everyone's schedule. If at times it feels like a member or two is rushing to finish a project, that's most likely because
finishing an assignment for this class allows everyone to focus on other classes. But compromising quality is never the goal. 
Feel free to reach out to the rest of the group if you do not feel prepared to contribute the project, or are not okay with the pace of the project. We will always work something out.
